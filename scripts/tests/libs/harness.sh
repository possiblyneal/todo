# shellcheck shell=bash
# Assertion counting and fixture primitives shared by scripts/tests/*-test.
#
# Sourced, never executed: no shebang, no executable bit, a .sh extension so
# linters recognize it. The same rule libs/detect.sh follows, for the same
# reason -- pre-commit reads a shebang only on an executable file, so a file
# carrying one without the bit is skipped in silence.
#
# What is here is what every suite would otherwise write identically: a scratch
# repository with the scripts copied in, a unit declaration, a command stubbed
# on PATH, and the counting. A fixture() that knows each suite's world is still
# not here -- it would take a parameter per suite and be read in three places
# to understand one. Each suite composes its world from these.
#
# Callers use `set -uo pipefail` without -e: a failing assertion is recorded and
# the remaining cases still run, so one break does not hide the rest.

# Every suite here scaffolds throwaway Git repositories, and a fixture inherits
# the operator's global config unless told not to. One setting breaks them
# outright: a machine-wide core.hooksPath, set for an unrelated purpose such as
# an editor's Git integration or another agent's attribution hook, redirects
# every fixture's hooks away from .git/hooks. `pre-commit install` still reports
# success and the hook then never fires, so a suite asserting that a hook blocks
# a commit watches the commit succeed and reports the operator's config as a
# defect in this repository.
#
# Neutralize it by isolating the fixtures from user and system config entirely
# rather than by unsetting the one key. A fixture reading anything from outside
# the repository is the bug in general, and the empty-string override for this
# key specifically is a trap: `git config core.hooksPath ""` satisfies
# pre-commit's refusal check and installs, and the hook still does not run.

# The same isolation for the two variables a real run reads from the ambient
# environment. An exported GOWORK points go_each at the modules of whatever
# workspace the developer is in, whose mains then build into the fixture's
# dist/. CI_DRY_RUN is exported by every invocation from scripts/ci, so a case
# asserting that something really ran or really deleted a file would pass by
# never running anything; a case wanting the dry run sets it per invocation.
