# shellcheck shell=bash
# How a check reports: the four Result states, the printed layout, the findings
# under a failed check, and the tally that becomes the process exit status.
#
# Sourced, never executed: no shebang, no executable bit, a .sh extension so
# linters recognize it. The same rule libs/detect.sh follows, for the same
# reason.
#
# The layout is an interface. A suite that greps a column relies on it:
#
#   <check>            <state>          <detail>
#                        <finding>
#
# The check name is padded to 18 columns and the state to 16, so a state is
# matched with `^<check> +<state>`; each finding sits on its own line under a
# FAIL, indented 21 spaces, so a finding is any line starting with whitespace.
# A state is one of pass, not-applicable, unavailable, or FAIL and nothing
# else: a check that did not run is not a check that passed, so unavailable
# fails the tally the same as FAIL does. One more word is accepted in the
# state column and is not a state: would-run, the dry-run marker for a check
# that was wired and not executed. It counts as neither, and prints in the
# same layout so a dry run reads like the run it stands in for.

result_failed=0

# The layout alone: result_line <check> <word> <detail>. What result prints
# once it has judged the state, and what a table that is not a set of Results
# -- the capability probe, whose words are wired and absent -- prints so it
# reads in the same columns. The widths live here and nowhere else.
result_line() {
  printf '%-18s %-16s %s\n' "$1" "$2" "$3"
}

# One line: result <check> <state> <detail>.

      return 1
