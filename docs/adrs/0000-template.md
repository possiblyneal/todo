# <Decision title, restated>

## Decision

<The full statement in one to three sentences, with scope: what this
covers and what it explicitly does not. The frontmatter description is
the one-line form; this is the precise form.>

## Context

<What forced the decision: the constraints, requirements, deadlines,
team skills, and pressures in play at the moment of commitment. This is
the section most often skipped and the most valuable — it is what lets
a future reader judge whether the decision still holds once conditions
have changed.>

## Alternatives Considered

<Optional — delete this heading and this note together when the section
would add nothing. Most ADRs won't need it.

One entry per option, each with why it was rejected. State the
rejection reason precisely enough that a reader can tell when it no
longer applies. If a reader can still ask "but why didn't we just…?",
this section has failed.>

## Consequences

<Optional — delete this heading and this note together when the section
would add nothing. Most ADRs won't need it.

What we accept as a result — good and bad. If only upsides are listed
this is a sales pitch, not a record; the honest costs are the payload.>
